<h2> <a name="venue"></a>The Venue: Laurel Mills Lodge</h2>

<p>Laurel Mills Lodge is a 27 acre rustic establishment nestled among towering trees in the Santa Cruz Mountains. 
It is located 2 1/2 miles from Highway 17, north of Scott's Valley.</p>  
<p>The road to the Lodge is narrow and winding, but once you arrive, the journey will be worth it.  
This is a laid back sort of place where you can relax with friends, hike the property, 
watch the wildlife, soak in the hot tub, decompress in the sauna, and of course, PARTY!   
There is a large outdoor deck for dancing next to Soquel Creek and a large meadow for relaxing and tent camping.  
You are welcome to arrive early, and stay late, to enjoy the property.</p>
<p> For more information about the lodge, 
check out their website: <a href="http://www.laurelmilllodge.com/">www.laurelmilllodge.com</a>

<p>
You may arrive any time after 12:00 noon to relax, or hike the property before the party begins.</p>

followed by Andre Thierry and Zydeco Magic playing from  3:30 p.m. - 8:00 p.m.  </p>

After the music ends, feel free to hop into the large hot tub, or enjoy a 
Bonfire in the Meadow before heading home.

<h2><a name="directions"></a>Directions and Carpooling</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.laurelmilllodge.com/mapbox/">
Map and directions</a>
</p>

<p><b>Please Note:</b>
Until recently, the lodge could be accessed from Southbound Highway 17 at the Laurel Exit.  
However, this exit (left turn across Highway 17) has been closed to Southbound Traffic for safety reasons.  
The proprietors now recommend that guests coming from San Jose southbound towards Santa Cruz, exit Highway 17 at Summit Rd. and then take San Jose-Soquel Rd. to Redwood Lodge Road (see map).  
Coming from Santa Cruz on Northbound Highway 17, cars can still turn right onto Laurel Rd. </p>

<p>Both Highway 17 and the smaller roads to the Lodge can be challenging to drive.  
Please be sure to have a designated driver or hang out after the party before driving home.</p>

<p>Please allow extra travel time due to beach traffic going from Silicon Valley to 
Santa Cruz on nice weekends.</p>

<h2><a name="parking"></a>Parking and Carpooling</h2>
<p>There is limited parking at Laurel Mills Lodge (50 cars).  Please try to carpool.  
Our home in Los Gatos can be used as a rendevous spot for carpooling: 
16181 Escobar Ave. Los Gatos. 95032. There is plenty of street parking near our house.
